My example for JTBD segementation with daily morning routines :

1.Example:

JTBD:

Push of the situation - The situation why I am going gym because to maintain my body health and physique , stay fresh in the morning and also go a walk to get fresh air in the morning to which made energetic full day

Habits of present - Now regularly going to gym and morning walk and going to bed earlier to make myself to  stay productive and healthier the whole day

Anxieties of adoption  - Before i will wake up very late and also going bed also will be more late which made tired full of the day 
Going to walk in the morning regularly

Pull of solution - Going to continue it everyday and stay healthy and still further planned to do meditation

2.Example:

JTBD:

Push of situation - health is a conscious matter we often forget to maintain or take care of, i faced immunity problem during my school days and due to that i faced sickness often

habits of present  - now I'm aware of that and taking care of myself such as 
eating fruits min 200g per day and wake up early and drink 3 liter of water and take dry fruits for snack is some of my habits which i try to follow daily and this help me to stay fresh every day

anxiety of adoption - lack of attention or activeness about an hour
and during school days i don't took it as a serious matter until i had admitted in hospital for 10 days before my public practical examination and i think those days were still hard to cross ,stress and exam preparations were gone but I've been in hospital with sickness.

pull of solution - be consistent in your work or habit it will give results as you expected , according to me health is wealth!
